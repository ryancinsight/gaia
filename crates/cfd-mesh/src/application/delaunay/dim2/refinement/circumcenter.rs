//! Circumcenter computation for triangles.
//!
//! # Theorem — Circumcenter as Voronoi Vertex
//!
//! **Statement**: The circumcenter of a Delaunay triangle is the Voronoi
//! vertex dual to the three generators.  It is equidistant from all three
//! vertices of the triangle.
//!
//! **Proof sketch**: The circumcenter is defined as the intersection of
//! the perpendicular bisectors of any two edges.  By construction, it is
//! equidistant from all three vertices, hence it is the center of the
//! unique circumscribed circle.
