//! Segment encroachment detection and resolution.
//!
//! # Definition — Encroached Segment
//!
//! A segment is *encroached* if there exists a vertex (other than its
//! endpoints) strictly inside its diametral circle (the circle whose
//! diameter is the segment).
//!
//! # Theorem — Segment Splitting Preserves Conformity
//!
//! **Statement**: If a segment is encroached, inserting its midpoint and
//! splitting the segment into two sub-segments produces a valid PSLG
//! refinement.  The new subsegments may themselves become encroached, but
//! the process terminates because segment lengths strictly decrease and
//! are bounded below by the local feature size.
//!
//! **Proof sketch**: The diametral circle of each subsegment is contained
//! within the diametral circle of the original segment, so the new
//! subsegments are "better separated" from vertices.  Ruppert (1995)
//! shows termination using a local feature size argument: no segment can
//! be split shorter than the local feature size $\text{lfs}(v)$ at its
//! midpoint.
//!
//! # Theorem — Local Encroachment Sufficiency (CDT Optimisation)
//!
//! **Statement**: In a CDT where segment $(a,b)$ is a constraint edge,
//! the only vertices that can encroach $(a,b)$ are the opposite vertices
//! of the (at most two) triangles incident on that edge.
//!
//! **Proof sketch**: Let $D$ be the diametral circle of $(a,b)$.  In a
//! CDT, $(a,b)$ is shared by at most two triangles $t_1 = (a,b,c)$ and
//! $t_2 = (a,b,d)$.  Any other vertex $v$ strictly inside $D$ would
//! violate the constrained empty-circumdisk property: $v$ would be inside
//! the circumcircle of $t_1$ or $t_2$ (since $D$ is contained in both
//! circumcircles when the triangle exists), and visibility through the
//! constraint edge is unrestricted for the opposite vertex.  Hence only
//! $c$ and $d$ need to be tested.  ∎
//!
//! **Complexity**: $O(1)$ per segment (two opposite-vertex lookups) vs
//! the naïve $O(T)$ full scan.
