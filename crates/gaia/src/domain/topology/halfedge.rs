//! # Half-Edge Topology Kernel
//!
//! The half-edge data structure is the topological backbone of [`crate::domain::mesh::Mesh`].
//! Every undirected edge in the mesh is represented as a pair of directed
//! *half-edges*, one per adjacent face. This gives O(1) local traversal for
//! all CFD stencil operations: face-to-face adjacency, vertex one-ring
//! neighborhoods, and boundary loop iteration.
//!
//! ## Structure
//!
//! ```text
//!          A
//!         / \
//!        /   \
//!      he0   he2      he0: A→B, face=△ABС, twin=he3, next=he1
//!      /  △1  \       he1: B→C, face=△ABC, twin=he_ext, next=he2
//!     B──he1──►C      he2: C→A, face=△ABC, twin=he_ext, next=he0
//!     ◄─he4───C       he3: B→A, face=△BDA, twin=he0, next=he5
//!      \  △2  /       he4: C→B, face=△CBD, twin=he1, next=he3 (approx)
//!      he5   he3      he5: D→C  ...
//!        \   /
//!          D
//! ```
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! All of the following hold for every half-edge `he` in a valid mesh:
//!
//! 1. **Twin involution**: `twin(twin(he)) == he`
//! 2. **Next-prev consistency**: `next(prev(he)) == he`  and  `prev(next(he)) == he`
//! 3. **Face-loop closure**: following `next` from any half-edge returns to `he`
//!    in a finite number of steps
//! 4. **Vertex-ring closure**: following `twin → next` from any half-edge
//!    returns to `he` in a finite number of steps (for interior vertices)
//! 5. **Face consistency**: `face(next(he)) == face(he)` (all half-edges in a
//!    face loop reference the same face)
//!
//! ## Theorem: Twin Involution
//!
//! **Statement**: The `twin` mapping is an involution on the set of half-edges:
//! `twin ∘ twin = id`.
//!
//! **Proof**: Each undirected edge `{u, v}` stores exactly two half-edges:
//! `he(u→v)` and `he(v→u)`. By construction, `twin(he(u→v)) = he(v→u)` and
//! `twin(he(v→u)) = he(u→v)`, so composing twice returns the original. ∎
//!
//! ## Theorem: 2-Manifold Condition
//!
//! **Statement**: A mesh is a combinatorial 2-manifold if and only if:
//! - Every interior edge has exactly 2 incident faces.
//! - Every boundary edge has exactly 1 incident face.
//! - The faces incident to each vertex form a single connected cycle
//!   (topological disk or half-disk for boundary vertices).
//!
//! **Proof sketch**: The local homeomorphism to ℝ² or ℝ²₊ at each point is
//! exactly encoded by these combinatorial conditions. Interior vertices have a
//! disk link; boundary vertices have a half-disk link. ∎
