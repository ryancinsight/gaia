//! Watertight checking.
//!
//! Validates a closed triangle mesh using four independent criteria:
//!
//! 1. **Manifold + closed**: every edge is shared by exactly 2 faces.
//! 2. **Euler characteristic**: `V - E + F = 2` for a genus-0 closed sphere.
//!    A torus gives `V - E + F = 0`, etc. Mismatches reveal topological defects.
//! 3. **Orientation consistency**: all face pairs sharing an edge have opposite
//!    directed-edge orientations (no two adjacent faces wind the same way).
//! 4. **Positive signed volume**: the divergence-theorem volume integral should
//!    be positive for an outward-oriented mesh.
//!
//! ## Euler's Theorem
//!
//! For a convex polyhedron (or any genus-0 closed surface):
//!
//! $$V - E + F = 2 \cdot (1 - g)$$
//!
//! where $g$ is the genus (number of handles). For a sphere or cube $g = 0$
//! so the characteristic is 2. A torus has $g = 1$ so the characteristic is 0.
//!
//! For a triangle mesh: $E = 3F/2$ (each face contributes 3 half-edges, each
//! edge is shared by exactly 2 faces in a manifold), so the relation reduces
//! to $V - E + F = 2$ for a closed manifold of genus 0.
